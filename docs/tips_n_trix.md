## Best practices for writing PHP code
- Follow the PSR (PHP Standards Recommendations) coding standards.
- Use meaningful variable and function names.
- Write modular and reusable code.
- Use comments and documentation to explain complex code.
- Keep your code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) by reusing code and avoiding duplication.
- Use version control (e.g., Git) to track changes and collaborate with others.
- Write tests for your code to ensure it works as expected.
- Use a linter (e.g., PHP_CodeSniffer) to enforce coding standards and catch potential issues.
